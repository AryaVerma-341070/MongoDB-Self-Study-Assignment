# Project Overview #
This project analyzes 10,000 synthetic records reflecting real-world patterns of coffee consumption, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes across 20 countries. The analysis was conducted using a customized dataset that includes behavioral data (e.g., Coffee_Intake, Smoking, Physical_Activity_Hours), demographic information (Age, Gender), and key health metrics (Sleep_Hours, Heart_Rate, BMI, Health_Issues).
# Key Business Insights #
1. High-Risk Segments: Caffeine & Age
The dashboard is structured to identify peak consumption and high-risk overlap. Interventions must target the age segment showing the highest concentration of coffee and alcohol consumption alongside elevated heart rates.

2. Sleep Quality Challenge: Smoking & Gender
The relationship between Sleep Duration and Smoking Status/Frequency reveals direct correlations. If the data shows one gender experiencing disproportionately worse sleep when smoking, health programs must be gender-specific to address the unique behavioral impact.

3. Stress and Activity Inverse Relationship
The visualization of Physical Activity vs. Stress Level will likely show an inverse relationship: higher stress correlates with lower activity. Wellness programs should therefore focus on low-barrier, accessible physical activity options to combat stress, rather than intensive fitness plans.

4. Holistic Wellness Opportunity: BMI & Sleep
A significant correlation between Total Sleep Hours and BMI Categories suggests that corporate wellness programs can drive impact by bundling interventions. Marketing messages promoting better sleep hygiene should be integrated with messaging about healthy weight management.
